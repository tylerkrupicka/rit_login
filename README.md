# RIT
A clone of the RIT login page - for good not evil.

This repository is an excercise in social engineering intended to illustrate a phishing attack. The server does not store or log passwords, however it is a fully working login screen using a semi-unrestricted HTTP Simple Auth page in RIT services.

Uses: Flask, requests
